  <h1>Cinext FAQ</h1>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>If I delete the app, will my lists hold if I re-download?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately not! In the future, we plan on introducing an account system to tackle this issue.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>A movie was suggested that was in one of my lists, and I had the toggle off â€” what's going on?</h3>
    <p>After extensive filtering, the film recommendation algorithm keeps 5 movies no matter what, to prevent empty suggestions. Try refining and further detailing your ask to pinpoint new movies. Be creative!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>Why did my request count for the day go down by 2 after one request?</h3>
    <p>If too many movies were filtered from the recommendations, we need to get more to satisfy the request and provide the best suggestions possible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>What are the kinds of things I can ask for in a movie?</h3>
    <p>There is a very wide range of things to ask for. Some areas, for example but not limited to, are: emotions, time periods, genres, niches, themes, directors, actors. Thinking outside the box and being detailed in your requests tends to yield the best results!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>Where are the ratings coming from?</h3>
    <p>Ratings come directly from TMDB, being an average of user ratings on that service.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>My requests just reset at an odd time?</h3>
    <p>Requests per day reset at 12:00 AM CST, so this will be different for users based on location.</p>
  </div>
