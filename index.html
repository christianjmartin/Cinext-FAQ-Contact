  <h1>Cinext FAQ</h1>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>What are the kinds of things I can ask for in a movie?</h3>
    <p>There is a very wide range of things to ask for. Some areas for example, but not limited to, are: Emotions, time periods, genres, niches, themes, directors, actors, visual style, writing style, pacing, tone, mood, and SO much more. Thinking outside the box and being detailed in your requests tends to yield the best results!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>My request is taking a while, what can I do?</h3>
    <p>In order to provide the best recommendations possible, some processing time is needed. This ranges from around 15-60 seconds. During this time, you are able to browse the rest of the app while your recommendations process, however we don't advise leaving the app during this time as it can mess up the process.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>A movie was suggested that was in one of my lists, and I had the toggle off, what's going on?</h3>
    <p>After extensive filtering, the film recommendation algorithm keeps 5 movies no matter what, to prevent empty suggestions. Try refining and further detailing your ask to pinpoint new movies. Be creative!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>Why did my request count for the day go down by 2 after one request?</h3>
    <p>If too many movies were filtered from the recommendations, we need to get more to satisfy the request and provide the best suggestions possible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>Where are the ratings coming from?</h3>
    <p>Ratings come directly from TMDB, being an average of user ratings on that service.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h3>My requests just reset at an odd time?</h3>
    <p>Requests per day reset at 12:00 AM CST, so this will be different for users based on location.</p>
  </div>
